*A TL;DR will be included at the bottom of this post.*

*This post will focus on the hardware of the System76 Lemur Pro. I understand that when I'm talking about the Lemur Pro, I'm pretty much also talking about the Clevo L140CU / L141CU.*

# Introduction

Hey everyone,

I'll just start off by saying: I love this machine. I came from using a late-2017 MacBook Pro 13" with a Touchbar, so I'll be comparing most things to that. Additionally, as of writing this, I've only had the Lemur Pro for about five days. Additionally, this is my first Linux-focused hardware purchase, let alone System76 purchase, so I'm excited to dive into the world of Linux Desktop!

# Ordering and Receiving

The ordering and receiving process was quite smooth. It shipped within eight or nine days of placing the order and arrived safely in a neat, eco-friendly box along with some other [goodies](https://imgur.com/a/5WMtP5g). I like that System76 packs a microfiber cloth as I used to find my fingerprints almost everywhere on my MacBook keyboard and Apple Logo. Even then, the Lemur Pro case is made of some form of magnesium-aluminum alloy which doesn't attract fingerprints, which I definitely appreciate. Any grease smudge found on the case, keyboard, or trackpad can be easily wiped away with that cloth.

As for the power cable, as many others have said before me, the length is really something left to be desired. I see the stock power cable as something that's good for a desk setup, but probably not the best for portability. That is unless you have a super-power for spotting outlets in literally any public space.

# Case

I particularly love how slim and sleek-looking the case is. The bottom-half just has some extra curves that my MacBook simply doesn't have. It just adds to the interesting shape and makes it a little more unique among other ultra-book models (i.e. MacBook Pro, Dell XPS, Thinkpad X1, etc.). The hinge is quite nice-looking, feels sturdy, and allows the screen a lot of flexibility -- a tad more than 180 degrees. This flexibility allows me a lot of new angles compared to my MacBook. For example, I could finally slump down horizontally on the couch with my legs up and rest the laptop almost vertically on my lap while also looking directly at the screen, not at some odd angle. Also, since this is my first laptop that's able to bend back 180 degrees, I just found it very amusing the first few times I pushed the screen all the way down on the desk. I don't know why, I just get easily amused.

Another thing about the case, it feels quite very sturdy and well-made. There's a slight bit of flex on the middle, around where the keyboard is and on the underside around the middle too. There's also a slight bit of flex on the screen when opening or closing it from the edge, but it's not much different than that of a MacBook Pro's screen. The hinge is a little more tight than the MacBook Pro's, but it's not much of an issue for me.

# Keyboard

The keyboard, the typing experience is simply amazing -- just enough action without compromising the thin-ness of the chassis. Definitely an improvement over the Macbook Pro's butterfly switches that I got used to (being jammed) over the past two years of using it (Apple eventually pushed out a fix for their keyboards). Additionally, I cannot explain the absolute joy I feel each time I press the "Escape" key. Trust me, two and a half years without an escape key was quite very annoying.
As noted in a few other posts, the placement of the Page-Up and Page-Down keys is a little annoying. When editing things in Vim, navigating in Ranger, typing in the terminal, and even drafting out this very post, I found myself accidentally tapping Page-Up or -Down and having to regain my bearings. I think it might be because I got used to the layouts on the MacBook Pro.

# Trackpad

The trackpad, on the other hand, definitely isn't an Apple touchpad. From the reviews of other Linux laptops I've seen around, there aren't really any manufacturers who use whatever magic Apple does with their trackpads. Regardless, the Lemur Pro trackpad is still quite good as compared to a few other laptops I've tested here and there. The action on the click button is a little heavier than something like an HP Chromebook 11 G5, but the surface is a lot smoother and easier to glide across. As opposed to the Apple touchpad, the click button is simply a button and not dictated by some form of Apple Force-Touch equivalent stuff. Because of this, it's a lot easier to click at the bottom of the Lemur's trackpad than on the top. Although it's still possible to click all the way at the top of the trackpad, I'm not sure who'd be masochistic enough to push that hard every time they click. Either way, it's a really nice trackpad regardless of if it's not Apple-like -- it doesn't really bother me at all. I do occasionally find myself swiping up with three fingers before forgetting that gestures weren't built into this machine. Perhaps there's a way to emulate the same gestures and such, but I haven't found a way so far. Again, it doesn't bother me on this either since I remember the keybinds quickly and just use the keyboard instead.

# Screen

The screen is honestly beautiful. I previously found myself getting annoyed at the gloss on my MacBook whenever I was studying in the library, so the matte display was a godsend. Of course, the display is 1920x1080, which is lower than the MacBook's 4k display, but I couldn't really tell the difference without putting my face closer than the keyboard (either that or my glasses are starting to fail me). I barely notice the difference between the Lemur Pro's 16:9 and the MacBook Pro's 16:10 aspect ratio. The top and side bezels are amazingly thin, as I've come to realize just earlier today while watching YouTube (unfortunately, Invidious was down). The extra inch paired with a thinner top-bezel makes the Lemur Pro's screen feel quite a bit larger than the MacBook's.

# Other Peripherals

**The camera** is just about what you'd expect from a laptop. Good enough for video calls, but not a DSLR. There's a little white light (an LED, I suspect) that indicates whether the camera is on or not, much like that little green light on the MacBook's camera too. What I find particularly neat is the ability to press Fn + F10 (on Pop!_OS) to toggle the camera on or off. This is by no means the same as a hardware solution like what you'd find on a Purism laptop, but it's a cool feature nonetheless. Something else I find interesting (at least interesting enough to comment on, but not much else) is that the area around the camera is glossy-glass as opposed to matte like the screen. Yep, interesting enough for a comment, but not really much else.
**The internal microphone**, I didn't test, so I can't speak too much on that topic. If I were to use a microphone, though, it's usually always through headphones or earbuds.

**The internal speakers** are comparable to my dad's old Nokia phone speakers. That is to say, they do their job and make noise. If you were looking to listen to anything more than notifications or five-minute tutorial videos all day, I'd suggest plugging in speakers or headphones because the sound from the 3.5mm jack is a **lot** better than the internal speakers. Of course, I'm picky on this front because I listen to music and podcasts pretty much all day and night. Overall, the internal speakers won't bother me much since I usually use earbuds when I'm outside and external speakers when I dock the laptop on my desk.

**The ports**, I love having USB Type-A ports! Such a breath of fresh air. Also, having that one USB Type-C port gives me the flexibility to dock the Lemur Pro to my USB Hub which I bought for my MacBook, which uses only Type-C's. The HDMI and USB Type-C both work on my external monitor just beautifully, the charging port works as expected, and charges quite quickly too. The USB 3.0 Type-A ports and the headphone jack pretty much do what they're meant to do. I haven't yet tested the Micro-SD slot, but I expect it'll work just as expected too. One thing I did notice on the USB Type-C port, however, was that whenever I plugged in my MacBook Pro's charging cable, the entire computer would just freeze up entirely until I reboot it from the power button. Annoying, and I suspect it's more of a software or firmware issue than a hardware issue. Other than that, everything works just as expected and quite well too.

# Specs

This Lemur Pro is sporting an **i7-10510U** and **24 GB RAM** as well as **750 GB NVMe SSD** storage. I ordered the laptop with just the i7, 8 GB RAM, and 250 GB NVMe because I found it was around $130 cheaper to order a 16 GB RAM stick and 500 GB M.2 NVMe from Amazon or Newegg. (Gotta save that money whilst in college!) That being said, before I added the additional components, everything was already buttery-smooth and more than capable for basic usage. The installation of both components was quite simple, especially with the help of (this guide)[https://tech-docs.system76.com/models/lemp9/repairs.html], just to make sure I don't destroy my machine within the first week of having it. After installing the M.2 card, the system was able to see it and create new partitions on it easily. After installing the 16 GB RAM, however, I pressed the power button and the light on the side turned on, but the screen didn't. It went on like this for about half a minute, keeping me scared that I accidentally borked my system, but after the first boot with the memory upgrade, it's been booting as quick as ever. I suspect this first-time boot slow-down was just because the system needed some time to get friendly with the new RAM. Perhaps it would have been easier for these two to get to know each other over some drinks? Either way, after installing it, my system's been as fast as ever without any noticeable issues.

# The Weight

**Goodness!** It's just so light. Lighter than my MacBook *and* rocking higher specs (age difference acknowledged), how much better can it get? I feel like I could just take this laptop anywhere on campus (when quarantine lifts) and never get tired or need to put my backpack down. Yes, it's just a touch lighter than a MacBook Pro 13", but I feel like there's a difference anyway.

# Oh yeah, and the Battery

I don't think people were lying when they said it could last around 21 hours when coding on VIM. I was using primarily VIM, Ranger, and zsh for a few hours straight and it only dropped a couple percent. The battery's probably the one thing I won't shut up about when talking about the laptop. For real, this Li-Ion 73 Wh battery will last *DAYS* of use on a single charge. Easily my favorite laptop battery of all time.
I previously made a comment on the power cable being a little short, but I think that as long as the battery isn't being misused, you could easily get your work done before even needing to think about a charge (depending on the load, of course).

# Closing Comments

Overall, I'm just in love with this laptop. The hardware is overall amazing and is being sold for quite a fair price too (compared to Apple products). Additionally, the fact that these laptops come stock with coreboot and open-source firmware just puts the cherry on top. I've been using Pop!_OS on this laptop after attempting (and failing) to install Debian 10. I'll probably go and re-attempt installing another distro later on when I have an Ethernet-to-USB cable. As of right now, however, I'll just continue enjoying what Pop!_OS offers for the general users while testing other distros on VMs.
**Thank you** for reading through my unnecessarily long review of this amazing laptop. I hope you've enjoyed reading it as much as I've enjoyed writing it. As for the TL;DR, here it is.

# TL;DR:

The System76 Lemur Pro is a really good laptop for just about anyone who wants a mid-to-high range ultrabook laptop that runs on open-source software. I feel it's a great candidate for people migrating from things like MacBook Pro's as these laptops offer high-end specs and very nice peripherals.

# Rating Table:
Category | Score | Note
---------|-------|----------
Usability | 8/10 | The speakers aren't anything to boast about. Trackpad isn't like an Apple one, but still enjoyable to use.
Specs | 9/10 | I've seen some good things going for AMD lately and would love to have seen an option for this. Regardless, the 10th-Gen Intel Cores are still really good. Additionally, having one RAM slot soldered with 8 GB is sort of limiting things, but I personally have no need for anything more than 24 GB.
Chassis | 9/10 | Loving the matte black color and the curves. Opening the case is as easy as just unscrewing twelve screws (which can get lost if one's not careful). Would love it if there's a little less flex.
Boot time | 10/10 | Super fast, I press the button and within that same minute, I'm already doing stuff.
Weight | 69/10 | Amazing, feather-like.
Battery | 420/10 | It's just crazy, okay?
Overall | 9.6/10 | I am quite satisfied with my purchase.
